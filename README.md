# BrainFuck
 BrainFuck language implemented in C

This project is still Work In Progress!

## Running
To run the program, you need to compile it first.

    $ gcc -o brainfuck brainfuck.c

Then you can run it:

    $ ./brainfuck input.bf

The program will output the result of the brainfuck code.
In this directory, you can find an example file of a bf implementation of Hello World in the Hello_World.bf file.

## Confession
I have to come clean about this project.

The github co-pilot did a huge amount of work for me. I have to say that I am very grateful to him. including most of this file. So this might be more of a testament to the co-pilot's work than my own.
yeah. co-pilot is a very good guy.
